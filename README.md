# Image Stock App

Welcome to the Image Stock App! üéâ This project allows you to upload images to Firebase, view your uploaded images, and ensure that only logged-in users can upload. Let‚Äôs get you set up and ready to start uploading!

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project was built using **Create React App** and incorporates several technologies:

- **Zustand** for state management (the one truth component).
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Firebase** for the database, authentication, and hosting.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above)
- A Firebase project set up in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lolaakinrinsola/ImageStock.git
   cd imageStock

### Install the dependencies

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   npm install

### Set up Firebase
3. Create a firebase project
    ```bash
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id

### Running the App

    ```bash
    npm start


Now open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. You‚Äôll see the app, and any changes you make will automatically reload!

## üé® Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is used throughout the app for styling. Feel free to customize the styles in the `tailwind.config.js` file to match your design preferences!

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode.
